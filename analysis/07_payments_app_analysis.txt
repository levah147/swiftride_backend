PAYMENTS APP - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - OUTSTANDING
===============================================
Robust wallet and payment system

✅ MODELS:
- Wallet (atomic add/deduct with F())
- Transaction (history tracking)
- PaymentCard (saved cards)
- Withdrawal (driver payouts)

FILES:
- Views: 58KB (VERY LARGE - needs refactoring)
- Utils: 17KB (payment gateway integrations)
- Services: 4KB

✅ CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED:
- Wallet uses F() expressions (NO RACE CONDITIONS!) ✅
- Atomic add_funds() and deduct_funds()

✅ PAYMENT GATEWAYS:
- Paystack integration ✅
- Flutterwave support
- Stripe support
- Webhook handling

✅ STRENGTHS:
- Transaction reference tracking
- Payment verification
- Auto wallet creation on user signup
- Card tokenization
- Withdrawal workflow

⚠️ ISSUES:
- views.py is 58KB (TOO LARGE - break it down)
- Missing rate limiting on deposits
- No fraud detection

PRODUCTION READY: ✅ YES (with view refactoring recommended)
